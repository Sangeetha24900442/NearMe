                The Christ Malabar Church in Senneerkuppam is part of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, which follows the East Syriac 
                liturgical tradition. The church, located in the Poonamallee area of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, serves the local Catholic 
                community, with the Syro-Malabar rite offering distinctive liturgical practices. The Syro-Malabar Church is one of the 
                largest Eastern Catholic communities globally, with its roots tracing back to the evangelistic work of St. Thomas the 
                Apostle in India. This church community is especially prevalent in Kerala, but also has a growing presence in other
                 parts of India and the world
